# Detailed Therapeutic Exercises for Cognitive Interventions

## 1. **Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CT-SP) Exercises**

### Exercise A: Crisis Cognitive Mapping

**Setup:** Get paper and draw three columns: "Trigger," "Thoughts," "Physical Sensations"

- Write down your most recent moment of intense suicidal thinking
- Map exactly what happened in the 2 hours before the thoughts started
- Identify the specific thought that shifted from "I'm struggling" to "I want to die"
- Rate the intensity (1-10) at each step

### Exercise B: Hope Kit Construction

**Materials needed:** Small box, index cards, photos

- Write 5 specific reasons you've stayed alive so far (not generic ones)
- Include one photo that connects you to a time you felt genuinely glad to be alive
- Add a letter from someone who would be devastated by your loss
- Record a voice memo of yourself describing one thing you want to see happen in the world

**RIGHT NOW - Crisis Response Practice:***You're feeling that familiar heaviness creeping in. Your mind is starting to whisper those dangerous thoughts. Stop. Take the next 60 seconds and do this:*

*Place both hands on your chest. Feel your heart beating. Say out loud: "This feeling has a beginning, middle, and end. I have survived every crisis before this moment. The part of me that wants to live is still here, even if it's quiet." Open your Hope Kit. Read one card. The suicidal part of your brain is not the part making decisions right now. The part reading these words is.*

## 2. **Behavioral Activation (BA) Exercises**

### Exercise A: Activity-Mood Correlation Tracking

**Daily Practice:** Set 4 phone alarms, rate mood 1-10 when they ring

- 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm: "Mood right now: ___"
- Write one activity you did in the past hour
- Note: "Avoided" or "Engaged" with the activity
- Track patterns over 1 week

### Exercise B: Behavioral Experiments for Prediction Testing

**This Week:** Pick one avoided activity, make specific predictions

- "If I go for a 10-minute walk, I predict I will feel ___"
- "I expect my energy level will be ___ afterward"
- "I think it will take ___ effort to complete"
Do the activity, then record actual results. Compare.

**RIGHT NOW - Activation Rescue:***You're sinking into that familiar quicksand of "nothing matters" and "I can't do anything." Your brain is telling you to stay in bed, scroll your phone, avoid everything. Here's what you're going to do in the next 5 minutes:*

*Stand up. Don't think about it, just do it. Walk to your kitchen. Get a glass of water and drink the whole thing. Now do ONE thing - wash one dish, make your bed, or step outside for 30 seconds. Notice: did your mood shift even 5%? Your brain just proved it can change its own chemistry through behavior. That's the evidence you needed.*

## 3. **Rumination-Focused CBT (RFCBT) Exercises**

### Exercise A: Process vs. Content Awareness

**When you catch yourself ruminating:**

- STOP and ask: "Am I trying to solve something or just spinning?"
- Write down the "Why" question you're asking yourself
- Rewrite it as a "How" or "What" question
- Example: "Why did this happen to me?" â†’ "What specific step can I take today?"

### Exercise B: Rumination Interruption Training

**Daily Practice:** Set random timer for 3 times per day

- When it goes off, notice: "What was I just thinking about?"
- If ruminating, immediately do: 20 jumping jacks OR name 7 blue objects OR count backward from 100 by 7s
- Return to your activity without judging yourself

**RIGHT NOW - Rumination Circuit Breaker:***You're in the loop again. That mental hamster wheel where the same thoughts spin round and round, getting nowhere but wearing you out. Your brain thinks it's solving something, but it's actually just creating more distress. Right now, interrupt it:*

*Put one hand on your stomach, one on your chest. Breathe so only the bottom hand moves - 4 counts in, 6 counts out. As you breathe, say: "Thinking about this more will not solve it. I can choose a different channel." Now do something that requires active attention - text someone, organize one small space, or do a crossword puzzle. Your rumination just lost its power.*

## 4. **Goal Management Training + Cognitive Remediation Exercises**

### Exercise A: Goal Hierarchy Breakdown

**Pick one overwhelming task:**

- Write the main goal at the top of a page
- Break into 3-5 major steps
- Break each major step into 2-4 smaller actions
- Identify the very first 5-minute action you could take
- Schedule that 5-minute action for a specific time today

### Exercise B: Metacognitive Monitoring Practice

**Throughout the day:**

- Set hourly reminders asking: "How clear is my thinking right now? (1-10)"
- If below 7, ask: "What does my brain need? Rest, food, movement, or break from stimulation?"
- Take appropriate 5-minute action

**RIGHT NOW - Executive Function Reset:***Your brain feels scattered, like trying to hold water in your hands. Everything feels urgent and impossible at the same time. You can't focus, can't prioritize, can't even figure out where to start. Time for a cognitive reboot:*

*Write down every task swirling in your head - don't organize, just dump them on paper. Now circle ONE that takes less than 10 minutes. Do only that one thing. When it's done, your executive function will have one success to build on. That's how you restart an overwhelmed cognitive system - one concrete completion at a time.*

## 5. **Grounding + DBT Distress Tolerance Exercises**

### Exercise A: 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Anchoring

**When dissociation/derealization starts:**

- 5 things you can see (name them out loud)
- 4 things you can touch (actually touch them)
- 3 things you can hear (listen actively)
- 2 things you can smell (breathe deeply)
- 1 thing you can taste (sip water or chew gum)

### Exercise B: Temperature Grounding

**Keep available:** Ice cubes, hot water, cold pack

- When feeling "floaty" or disconnected, hold ice for 30 seconds
- Alternate between cold and warmth on your wrists
- Cold shower for 30 seconds if severely dissociated

**RIGHT NOW - Reality Anchoring:***You're drifting away from yourself. The world feels unreal, like you're watching your life through glass. Your body doesn't feel like yours, and nothing seems solid or trustworthy. You need to come back to your body, back to this moment:*

*Press your feet firmly into the floor. Say out loud: "My name is [your name]. Today is [day/date]. I am in [location]." Now press your palms together hard and hold for 10 seconds. Feel that pressure. That's real. You're real. This moment is real. The disconnected feeling is temporary - your nervous system is just protecting you, but you're safe enough to come back now.*

## 6. **Structured Narrative Organization Exercises**

### Exercise A: Timeline Reconstruction

**For overwhelming experiences:**

- Draw a line across a paper
- Mark "Beginning," "Middle," "End"
- Fill in only facts first (what actually happened)
- Add emotions in a different color
- Add meanings/interpretations in a third color
- Notice which parts feel most confusing or fragmented

### Exercise B: Story Coherence Building

**Weekly practice:**

- Write 3 sentences about your week: What happened, how you felt, what you learned
- Connect this week to last week: "This connects to last week because..."
- Look ahead: "This might influence next week by..."

**RIGHT NOW - Narrative Threading:***Your life feels like scattered puzzle pieces that don't fit together. Past, present, and future seem disconnected. You can't make sense of your own story. Let's create one thread of coherence:*

*Take 3 minutes and write: "One month ago I was struggling with ___. Today I am dealing with ___. These connect because ___. Tomorrow I will ___." Even if it's messy, even if it's partial, you just created a bridge between past, present, and future. Your story has continuity, even when it doesn't feel like it.*

## 7. **GOALS Program + Value-Based Interventions**

### Exercise A: Goal Flexibility Assessment

**For each major goal you have:**

- Rate importance: 1-10
- Rate achievability in current circumstances: 1-10
- If achievability is below 7, brainstorm 3 alternative paths to the same underlying value
- Identify what you're really seeking (security, connection, purpose, etc.)

### Exercise B: Multiple Pathways Mapping

**Visual exercise:**

- Draw your main goal in the center of a paper
- Draw 5-7 different paths leading to it
- Include unconventional routes you hadn't considered
- Circle the 2-3 most realistic given your current situation

**RIGHT NOW - Entrapment Escape:***You feel trapped, like you're in a tunnel with only one way out, and that way is blocked. Every path forward seems impossible. You're stuck and the walls are closing in. Time to find the hidden exits:*

*Name the thing you want most right now. Now ask: "What am I really seeking underneath this want?" Write down 3 completely different ways you could get that underlying need met - even weird or imperfect ways. You just proved to your brain that you're not trapped. There are always more options than the one you're fixated on. Always.*

## 8. **Meaning-Making Integration Exercises**

### Exercise A: Daily Meaning Tracking

**Each evening:**

- Write one moment today that felt meaningful (however small)
- Connect it to a larger value or purpose you hold
- Rate your sense of life meaning today: 1-10
- Note patterns over time

### Exercise B: Existential Load Reduction

**When overwhelmed by life's big questions:**

- Set a timer for 10 minutes
- Write freely about the big existential question troubling you
- When timer goes off, stop
- Ask: "What's one small action I can take today that aligns with my values?"
- Do that action within 24 hours

**RIGHT NOW - Meaning Rescue:***Everything feels pointless. The weight of existence feels crushing, and you can't remember why anything matters. The big questions are swallowing you whole, and you're drowning in the vastness of it all. Let's find one small light:*

*Think of one person whose life is slightly better because you exist. One person. Maybe you made them laugh once, helped them with something, or just listened when they needed it. Hold that image. That's meaning - not cosmic meaning, but real, human meaning. You matter in ways you can't even see. Right now, do one tiny thing that reflects who you want to be in the world. That's purpose enough for today.*

## **Emergency Integration Protocol**

**When everything is falling apart simultaneously:**

1. **Physical grounding** (30 seconds): Feel your feet, name your location
2. **Cognitive anchoring** (1 minute): "I am having thoughts and feelings, but I am not only my thoughts and feelings"
3. **Behavioral activation** (5 minutes): One small concrete action
4. **Narrative coherence** (2 minutes): "Right now I am struggling with ___, and that makes sense because ___"
5. **Meaning connection** (1 minute): "One small way I can honor my values today is ___"

*Remember: You don't have to fix everything at once. You just have to take the next right step.*
