- **Behavioral-Engagement**: Using behavior to shift internal state
- **Micro-Accomplishment**: Completing small tasks to rebuild agency
- **Completion-Recognition**: Acknowledging small accomplishments
- **Momentum-Detection**: Noticing when action creates more capacity for action

## **Cluster 11: Integration & Resolution**
*Patterns that resolve conflicts and create coherence from opposing forces*

- **Both-And-Thinking**: Moving from either/or to integration
- **Integration-Seeking**: Finding ways to honor multiple valid needs
- **Conflict-Resolution**: Turning internal enemies into advisors  
- **False-Dichotomy-Recognition**: Seeing beyond apparent either/or choices
- **Protective-Function-Recognition**: Understanding how all parts try to help

## **Cluster 12: Value Connection & Meaning-Making**
*Patterns that connect actions and experiences to deeper purpose*

- **Value-Linking**: Connecting actions to deeper personal values
- **Value-Anchoring**: Using core values as stability during crisis
- **Value-Clarification**: Getting clear on what actually matters
- **Meaning-Reconstruction**: Finding purpose in ordinary experiences
- **Meaning-As-Process**: Viewing meaning as created rather than found

## **Cluster 13: Agency & Choice Recognition**
*Patterns that restore sense of personal power and options*

- **Agency-Recognition**: Noticing capacity for choice and decision
- **Micro-Agency**: Recognizing small choices available in any moment
- **Option-Permanence**: Remembering there are always more options
- **Exit-Multiplication**: Finding alternative paths when primary route blocked
- **Choice-Expansion**: Seeing more possibilities for action

## **Summary: 62 Patterns Organized into 15 Functional Clusters**

These clusters represent different cognitive mechanisms for shifting mental states:

1. **Control patterns** interrupt and redirect automatic processes
2. **Grounding patterns** use body awareness to stabilize mind
3. **Structure patterns** organize chaos into manageable forms
4. **Scaling patterns** create perspective through measurement
5. **Observer patterns** separate experiencing from observing self
6. **Systems patterns** understand underlying mechanisms
7. **Time patterns** organize experience across temporal dimensions
8. **Evidence patterns** test beliefs against reality
9. **Reframe patterns** shift interpretation and viewpoint
10. **Action patterns** create momentum through behavior
11. **Integration patterns** resolve internal conflicts
12. **Meaning patterns** connect to deeper purpose
13. **Agency patterns** restore sense of choice and power
14. **Acceptance patterns** work adaptively with current reality
15. **Validation patterns** use proof of capability to build confidence

Each cluster addresses different aspects of cognitive functioning and can be applied based on the specific type of mental challenge being faced.
