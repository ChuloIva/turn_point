"Ugh, even getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain right now. It's as if my brain has just decided to quit on me and my motivation is nowhere to be found. Why bother with self-care or productivity when everything just feels so pointless anyway?","I'm feeling stuck and unmotivated to get out of bed, but I need to assess my goals. Right now, I'd rate my motivation goal as a 4 in importance and a 2 in achievability. That's really low.

I'm thinking of Sarah, and how I helped her move last weekend. She was really grateful, and we had some laughs together. That image is still with me... You matter to someone, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Alright, one tiny thing: I'll send a funny meme to Sarah just because.
